Perhaps the biggest challenge in making holograms usable on a daily basis -- aside from having to film your subject with a million trillion cameras -- is in getting their refresh rates up to the levels we're used to with normal two-dimensional video . We are still a fair way away from those magical 30fps , but the University of Arizona is touting a heretofore unheard of redraw rate of once every two seconds . This is a major advance from their first dynamic holograms demonstrated two years ago , which required minutes to swap over to a new image .
