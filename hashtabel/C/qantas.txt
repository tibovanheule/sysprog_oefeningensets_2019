The Australian airline Qantas has grounded its six-strong fleet of Airbus A380 airliners after one of the superjumbos made an emergency landing . Qantas flight QF32 experienced engine trouble shortly after taking off from Singapore on its way to Sydney . One of the engines exploded with a bang , a passenger told the BBC , and debris was found on an island below . Singapore Airlines said its A380 flights would be delayed pending technical checks . Engine maker Rolls-Royce said it was in the process of checking the 20 A380 planes currently in service - with Qantas , Singapore and Lufthansa - that use its Trent 900 engines . It said the safe operation of our products is our number one priority . The other 17 A380s in service - with Air France and Emirates - use another engine . One area of investigation will be a European Aviation Safety Agency airworthiness report in August that flagged up one potential problem with the engine . There is no evidence that this is linked to the latest incident .
